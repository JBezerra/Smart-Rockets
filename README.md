# Smart Rockets
This project is a fun little demo of a genetic algorithm. A population of rockets attempt to find their way to a a target.

**Just put some obstacles, and watch the little rockets doing its job!**

In that project, you can play with some rockets that want to get to the target, your job is put an obstacle and see them autoevolving finding its own path!

# How it works?
The rockets will learn how to get to the target point autoenvolving.
In short, in that genetic algorithm, we create a generation of rockets that moves randomly.
After that, we filter the best ones and create anothers ones based in the moviments of the bests.

For best explanations see [another Genetic Algorithm here](https://github.com/JBezerra/The-Shakespeare-and-Monkey-Problem) where I give best explanations of how and why use G.A!
